ZOMGOctocatz
============

This small utility will download all the Octocats on the [Octodex](http://octodex.github.com) because i want to have my Windows desktop be full of fun. All the Octocats get downloaded to the `Octocatz` folder in your `Pictures` library or in a directory of your choosing. To set the output directory, pass the output directory's path as an argument to the utility. The utility will create that directory if it doesn't exist.

## Where do i get it?

[Download it here](https://github.com/downloads/jugglingnutcase/ZOMGOctocatz/ZOMGOctocatz.zip)

## How do i run it?

i think you can just unzip the download and double-click the executable... assuming i did everything right.

To run it from code, clone and run the `build.ps1` powershell script.

## It doesn't work!

i'm pretty sure (i haven't tried though) that this will only work on Windows 7. If i'm wrong [i would love to know about it](http://twitter.com/jugglingnutcase).

[Create an issue](https://github.com/jugglingnutcase/ZOMGOctocatz/issues) or tweet me [@jugglingnutcase](http://twitter.com/jugglingnutcase) and i'll try my best to take care of it.
