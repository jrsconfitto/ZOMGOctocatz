ZOMGOctocatz
============

This small utility will download all the Octocats on the [Octodex](http://octodex.github.com) because i want to have my Windows desktop be full of fun. All the Octocats get downloaded to the `Octocatz` folder in your `Pictures` library.

## Where do i get it?

[Download it here](https://github.com/downloads/jugglingnutcase/ZOMGOctocatz/ZOMGOctocatz.zip)

## How do i run it?

i think you can just unzip the download and double-click the executable... assuming i did everything right.

To run it from code, clone and run the `build.ps1` powershell script.

## It doesn't work!

i'm pretty sure (i haven't tried though) that this will only work on Windows 7. If i'm wrong [i would love to know about it](http://twitter.com/jugglingnutcase).

[Create an issue](https://github.com/jugglingnutcase/ZOMGOctocatz/issues) or tweet me [@jugglingnutcase](http://twitter.com/jugglingnutcase) and i'll try my best to take care of it.

## i'm so mad(ly in love) with this project that i want to help

Buuhhhhh-OK! Fork and PR :)

i dont know why you'd want to dig into this horrible hacky code that most likely isn't worth your time, but if you want to teach me how the real .NET programmers write code, then i will happy enjoy the lesson :) (Seriously, no sarcasm. i would love input on how to write better code)

You'll want [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to run the build script.
